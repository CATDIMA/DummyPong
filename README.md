# DummyPong
 Pong game that I made to practise move-semantics, smart pointers, WinAPI and CMake

 ## Description
 Some kind of pet-project. It has several bugs and it can work unstable. Someday I will fix it
 but I would rather re-write it on Linux with ncurses. An architecture of this app allows me to
 make another game for windows terminal by changing states definitions in a state machine and by 
 changing .txt assets. Also there are a lot of possible improvements in architecture itself.

 ## Building and installation
 Install CMake before building

 Clone this repository, open CMD with admin rights, go to the directory with DummyPong
 source code and run these commands:
 ```
set PATH="C:\Program Files\CMake\bin\";%PATH%
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Release
cmake --install . --config Release
 ```
